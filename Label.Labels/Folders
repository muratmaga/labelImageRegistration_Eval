Folder designate the label that was held out during the label registration. The resultant labelmap in the folder indicates the reference labelmaps in subject space through inverse transform.

Manually edited and review gold standard labels are in: /home2/rachel/P01/MagaLab/Data/RigidAligned/fullRes_simpleLabels/
